Generated NH graph:
NHGraph = contains list of Ball
Ball = contains LocalView
LocalView = contains >the color of the local node
                     >the colors of the neighbor nodes
                     >bool, if it can be adjacented with another ball

generate_graph: functioning for r=1 (no duplicates)


color_networkx: currently no further implementations
