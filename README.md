Generated NH graph:
NHGraph = contains list of Ball
Ball = contains LocalView
LocalView = contains >the color of the local node
                     >the colors of the neighbor nodes
                     >bool, if it can be adjacented with another ball

generate_graph: > 1.Try: generating graphs with while and for loops ->
                  getting too complex too soon, edge cases and duplicated
                  get out of hand -> new approach needed
                > 2.Try: dictionary with "My color" values and "Neighbor color" values for better results
                  -> currently working on



color_graph_ntwork: currently no further implementations
